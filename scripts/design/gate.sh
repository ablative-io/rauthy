# The docs leg of .land/gates.sh: every design document under docs/design validates against the
# method's schemas; every cluster's coverage is clean; and every cluster's rendered markdown is
# what its JSON renders to, so a brief that breaks brief.schema.json or a DESIGN.md that drifted
# from design.json cannot land. A cluster is one with a design.json; docs/design/identity holds
# the earlier revision-form briefs (IDENTITY-001, CONTEXT-001) that predate the method and are
# not measured here. Runs from the repository root in a fresh clone.
