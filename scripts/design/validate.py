"""Validate design-system JSON documents against their schemas.

Usage:
  validate.py <path>

<path> is either a single JSON document or a directory. Directories are
searched recursively and documents are discovered by name.

The schema subset includes oneOf, which a gate entry needs: an entry is
either the three-line shorthand or the named legs a repository declares,
and exactly one of those shapes must match.

Documents are discovered by name:

  roadmap.json    -> roadmap.schema.json
  decisions.json  -> decisions.schema.json
  project.json    -> project.schema.json
  design.json     -> design.schema.json
  checklist.json  -> checklist.schema.json
  stories.json    -> stories.schema.json
  briefs/<ID>.json -> brief.schema.json (not <ID>-input.json run records)

Schemas are resolved relative to this script's own location
(../schemas/). The validator implements exactly the subset the v2
schemas use: type (object/array/string/boolean/integer), required,
additionalProperties:false, properties, items, enum, pattern, minItems,
oneOf.

Every violation is reported with a JSON-pointer-style path
(e.g. items/3/provenance/quote: missing required field). Exits 1 if any
violation is found. A directory containing no known documents is
reported but is not an error.

Beside the schema subset, one rule the schemas cannot state: no document
names a machine. A design's gate trees and its structure and inventory
paths, and a brief's requirement file paths, are read on whatever machine
the document is fired on, so an absolute path is one machine's and the
same document cannot run on the next. A path inside the repository is
spelled relative to the repository root; a path outside it is spelled
with a root token ($NAME/...) the ledger resolves from its launch
settings and refuses by name when the launch set none. A root-token path
is accepted here as written and never resolved: the validator runs on
machines no root of that document is set on. The exception is a brief
that already carries an execution record: what a round measured is kept
as written, absolute paths and all.
